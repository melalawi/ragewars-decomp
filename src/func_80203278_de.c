/* Picks a rider's nearest target: walks the player list D_80145060 for players within the segment's range at 0x54 (squared distance through func_802726BC_de) that are not the rider's own player, are active and, in team play (D_801468C4), are on the other team, keeps those with a clear line of sight between their raised centres through func_802444A4_de (or whose blocker is the player itself), and records the nearest in the rider at 0x80 and in the result with its distance through func_802B72B0_de, clearing both when none qualifies. */
