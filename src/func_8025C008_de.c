/* Releases every occupied slot of a record, other than the one its header marks as local, whose mask at slot offset 0xA4 shares a bit with the given value: marks it active, clears its flag and, when its key differs from its owner's, restarts the owner's sound with the slot's sample and invalidates the slot. Adapted from func_8025BE08_de with the equality test on the value at 0xA8 replaced by a bit test on the mask at 0xA4. */
