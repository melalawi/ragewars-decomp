/* Releases every occupied slot of a record, other than the one its header marks as local, whose value at slot offset 0xB4 equals the given value: marks it active, clears its flag and, when its key differs from its owner's, restarts the owner's sound with the slot's sample and invalidates the slot. Adapted from func_8025BE08_de with the compared slot field moved from offset 0xA8 to 0xB4. */
