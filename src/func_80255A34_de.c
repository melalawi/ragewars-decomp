/* Allocates from the top of a heap's free space with a first-fit search of its free list: the request plus the 0x20-byte header is rounded up to 16 bytes and carved from the end of the found block's free space; the found block leaves the free list once its free space is used up, the new block is linked after it in address order, and its data pointer is returned (0 when nothing fits). */
