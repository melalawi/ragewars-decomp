/* Receives player p's 0x648-byte packet through func_80404F58 into the buffer at 0x2E28 of the
   records D_800E54A4 points to and, when func_804057F8 checksums its first 0x640 bytes to the
   word stored after them, copies those bytes to the data at 0x18 of the player's 2920-byte record
   at 0x58 and the trailing word at 0x640 to the record's last word, returning 1; otherwise it reports the failure through
   func_80404858, marks both of the record's states at 0x0 and 0x14 as 2 and returns 0. Written
   from the assembly with nested tests each reporting the failure, which GCC cross-jumps into one
   call. */
