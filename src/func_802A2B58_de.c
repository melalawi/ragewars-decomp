/* Rebuilds one morphing mesh's vertices from its two key frames. The blend weight eases in and out
   of the clock's position in the actor's track, and again of the actor's own position in it while
   that is still inside the track; every vertex is then the first frame's position carried that far
   toward the second's, its two texture coordinates are the mesh's own scales times the caller's
   scale and times a fade that steps once a vertex, and its shade is the blend of the vertex's two
   shades. While func_8026E340_de holds, the shade is instead greyed: red and green are cleared and
   blue carries the blended sum of the three channels over three, as an unsigned divide. Written
   from the assembly: the second frame's key is taken before the first frame's sample is read so
   that it lives across that call, and the first shade is reached through its own pointer, which is
   what keeps the blend cursor itself in a register rather than the whole record being addressed
   four bytes on. */
